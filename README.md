# Learning_Java
Learning Java as a Programming Language. So will be posting the questions I solve every day from beginner level to advance level.

Currently, I am going through the basics. Introduction to java, input/output, variables, datatypes. Further moving on to the conditional statements, then to loops. And now solving some parttern questions.
Now, I am goping to learn about functions and methods.
