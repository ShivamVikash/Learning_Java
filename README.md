# Learning_Java
Keeping in mind the skills as well as the placements, 
Started learning Java as a Programming Language. So will be posting the questions of different I solve every day from beginner level to advance level.

Currently, I am going through the basics. Introduction to java, input/output, variables, datatypes. Further moving on to the conditional statements, then to loops. And now solving some parttern questions.
Now, I am goping to learn about functions and methods.
After successfully completing the basics now I am getting into some exercises..

Then, stepping into a new module of time complexity.
