# Learning_Java
Keeping in mind the skills as well as the placements, 
Started learning Java as a Programming Language. So will be posting the questions of different I solve every day from beginner level to advance level.

Currently, I am going through the basics. Introduction to java, input/output, variables, datatypes. Further moving on to the conditional statements, then to loops. And then solving some parttern questions. Furthermore, getting to learn about functions and methods. After successfully completing the basics now getting into some exercises..

after a while, stepping into a new module of time and space complexity.
